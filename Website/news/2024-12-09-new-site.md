# New site published
We finally got around to starting to create a site for Compze.
It is *very* minimal right now, essentially just containing the start page that pitches what Compze is all about, but we expect to be expanding on it soon.

It is built using [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) which means that we can mix content with real C# code with ease. We plan to leverage that to produce some excellent documentation soon!
