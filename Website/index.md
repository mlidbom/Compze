## Mining maintainable structure from complexity and chaos
Compze aims to provide tooling that alleviates, or outright eliminates, those frustrating issue that feel like they should have solutions, but don't appear to.

### Paradigm shifts
There are areas where it seems to us like the industry at large is stuck in old models. Not realizing that paradigm shifts are required. \
We feel that it would not be hyperbolic to say these tools enable a paradigm shift in system design.\
We don't claim to be the inventors of these paradigms, but we do aim to make them accessible, widely understood, and popular.

### Filling in cracks / Scratching that persistent itch
Some of those problems doesn't need very much code to resolve them. You might say they are just cracks that need to be filled in:
