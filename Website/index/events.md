#### Compze.Events
Leveraging C# interface inheritance and generic variance enables
* A powerful universal event modeling paradigm which
  * Gives un unprecedented ability to understand domains in terms of how the events that can occur relate to each other.
  * Eliminates all need for manual event routing and type checking.
  * Enables modeling inheritance and composition of event based aggregates with elegant ease and precision.
  * Unifies fine-grained property-updated style events and coarse-grained domain events.
  * Enables listening to precisely the event you need, yet be guaranteed that when new events are added, inheriting the current event, you will receive those too.
