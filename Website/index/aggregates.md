#### Compze.Aggregates
* Build maintainable Compze.Events based domain aggregates.
* Compose aggregates out of reusable event based
  * Aggregate base classes 
  * Components
  * Entities
* Store your aggregates however you like. Event store optional.
  * Note: Much/most of the maintenance pain of event driven systems lie in the constraints imposed by event sourcing and the requirement to maintain events forever. Well, if you don't need that, just skip it!
